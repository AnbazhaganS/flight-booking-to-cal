Regarding the issue of calendar events not being automatically created from itinerary emails, it appears that users have faced similar challenges, particularly with certain features not working as expected. For instance, in the case of the iOS Calendar App, it's noted that events weren't automatically added from emails containing dates or locations, despite the 'Events Found in Apps' feature being enabled. Solutions that users found helpful included ensuring that specific settings like 3D Touch were enabled, and performing basic troubleshooting steps like restarting the device or resetting settings.

As for the security warning when importing .ics files into Outlook, this is a common security measure by email clients to protect against potentially harmful content. The warning doesn't necessarily mean that the file is malicious, but it's a precaution for files from unverified or unknown sources.

I'm not an expert in web development, but I wanted a quick and easy solution. This project was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT to create a simple and user-friendly web application for generating calendar events from flight details.
